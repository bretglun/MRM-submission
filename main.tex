\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Here, the purpose of the study should be described, along with some background.
“Bulk” citations should be avoided. 
Instead, authors are encouraged to weave explanatory text around the citations so that the reader can better appreciate their connection to the current paper. 
If the work is hypothesis-driven, authors are encouraged to include the hypothesis in this section.
Please lay out your article using the section headings and example objects below, and remember to delete all help text prior to submitting your article to the journal.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{example-image-rectangle}
\caption{
    Although we encourage authors to send us the highest-quality figures possible, for peer-review purposes we are can accept a wide variety of formats, sizes, and resolutions. 
    Legends should be concise but comprehensive – the figure and its legend must be understandable without reference to the text. 
    Include definitions of any symbols used and define/explain all abbreviations and units of measurement.
}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Second Level Heading}
Subheadings are allowed, and their use is left to the discretion of authors. 
Authors are encouraged to use subheadings in long papers, particularly in the “Results” and “Discussion” sections. 

If data, scripts or other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the article are available via a publicly available data repository, please include a reference to the location of the material within the article.

% Equations should be inserted using standard LaTeX equation and eqnarray environments, not as graphics, and should be set in the main text
This is an equation, numbered
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{+\infty}e^{-x^2}dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\end{equation}
And one that is not numbered
\begin{equation*}
e^{i\pi}=-1
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Adding Citations and a References List}

Please use a \verb|.bib| file to store your references. 
When using Overleaf to prepare your manuscript, you can upload a \verb|.bib| file or import your Mendeley, CiteULike or Zotero library directly as a \verb|.bib| file\footnote{see \url{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}}. 
You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{lees2010theoretical}. 
Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

You can find a video tutorial here to learn more about BibTeX: \url{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}.

\subsubsection{Third Level Heading}
Supporting information will be included with the published article. 
For submission any supporting information should be supplied as separate files but referred to in the text.

Appendices will be published after the references. 
For submission they should be supplied as separate files but referred to in the text.

\paragraph{Fourth Level Heading}
% Here are examples of quotes and epigraphs.
\begin{quote}
The significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which we created them.\endnote{Albert Einstein said this.}
\end{quote}

\begin{epigraph}{Albert Einstein}
Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.
\end{epigraph}

\subparagraph{Fifth level heading}
Measurements should be given in SI or SI-derived units.
Chemical substances should be referred to by the generic name only. 
Trade names should not be used. 
Drugs should be referred to by their generic names. 
If proprietary drugs have been used in the study, refer to these by their generic name, mentioning the proprietary name, and the name and location of the manufacturer, in parentheses.

\section{Theory}
A “Theory” section may be included after the Introduction, if a need exists. 
In the Theory section, detailed mathematical derivations can be accommodated. 
Alternatively, such derivations may be included in an Appendix. 
In general, the use of appendices is discouraged, but exceptions will be made if, for example, the work’s essence can be understood by readers without the need to grasp the details of the mathematical treatment. 
When present, appendices are included in the word count.

\section{Methods}
“Methods” (not “Materials and Methods”) should succinctly describe the techniques and instrumentation used, define the patient population, etc.

\section{Results}
Here, significant findings and observations should be described. 
The section should not be a repetition of the figure captions.

\section{Discussion}
Here, the results should be critically evaluated and interpreted and placed in the context of existing literature. 
Further, authors should highlight whether the data are in agreement or at variance with prior published findings. 
If a new method has been presented, its performance should be critically assessed and compared with alternative methods. 
Speculation and extrapolation should be minimized or avoided altogether, and, if presented, must be clearly identified as such and confined to the Discussion section.

\section{Conclusion}
In “Conclusions” (which may be merged with “Discussion” into “Discussion and Conclusions” provided no speculation or extrapolation is presented) authors should state what can be concluded from the data presented. 
Please avoid making excessive claims.

\caption{
    This is a table. Tables should be self-contained and complement, but not duplicate, information contained in the text. 
    They should be not be provided as images. 
    Legends should be concise but comprehensive – the table, legend and footnotes must be understandable without reference to the text. 
    All abbreviations must be defined in footnotes.

\section*{acknowledgements}
An Acknowledgements section is optional and is placed between Conclusions and References. 
It is appropriate to acknowledge sources of funding and also to thank colleagues or coworkers for assistance in conducting the research or help with the writing of the manuscript. 
However, the practice of acknowledging typists and illustrators should be avoided, as should the use of flowery or effusive statements. 
Because journal space is very limited, the acknowledgment of anonymous referees is also discouraged.

\section*{conflict of interest}
You may be asked to provide a conflict of interest statement during the submission process. 
Please check the journal's author guidelines for details on what to include in this section. 
Please ensure you liaise with all co-authors to confirm agreement with the final statement.
